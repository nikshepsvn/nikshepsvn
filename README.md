My passion lies in building incredible experiences to push the boundaries of human creativity by unlocking a new paradigm of interaction powered by generative AI. I have an extremely strong foundation in the AI engineering space, with a deep understanding of multimodal models (transformers + diffusion), fine-tuning, vector databases / RAG, prompt engineering, structured output, generative UI and other subject matter. I am consistently up to date with the cutting edge advancements in the field and would love to chat if you want to have a conversation about interesting topics -- feel free to reach out for a chat at either nikshep@atmanventures.co or nikshep@dreamloom.ai
