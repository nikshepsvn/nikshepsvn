### About Me

I work at the intersection of applied AI and crypto. The goal is to compound—learn by building, build to learn more, repeat at higher stakes.

Been in AI since before the frameworks existed. For RealmPlay, I productionized a fine-tuned Llama on rented 3090s via vast.ai, built a serving API on exllama, and used a DO droplet with nginx as a multi-region load balancer—before vLLM or any proper serving infra existed. Extended context from 4K to 16K with SuperHOT the day kaiokendev posted about RoPE scaling. When most of this was still forum posts and arxiv papers, I was shipping.

Same with crypto. Mining ETH at $35 in 2016, did dev work for a token that hit $50M+ marketcap, been building through every cycle since.

Recent projects: prediction market monitors, Claude code leaderboards, multi-agent swarms on Solana, real-time interactive video, LoRA marketplaces, a YouTube thumbnail copilot that got paying customers. Earlier: hackathon wins, a 10M-view automated YouTube channel, and too many side quests to list.

Infra and fullstack by trade, but applied AI and crypto is where I live now.
