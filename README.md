sold two startups: [RealmPlay](https://realmplay.ai) (character AI but running fine-tuned llama on consumer GPUs) and [SoulBazaar](https://soulbazaar.ai) (autonomous social agents for web3).

### about me

i work at the intersection of applied AI and crypto. goal is to compound — keep building, keep learning, play bigger games over time.

been in AI for a while. for RealmPlay i productionized a fine-tuned llama on rented 3090s via vast.ai, built a serving API on exllama, used a DO droplet with nginx as a load balancer. this was before vLLM. extended context from 4K to 16K using SuperHOT right when RoPE scaling was discovered.

getting deeper into ML/RL now. built LACUNA — RL agent that trades polymarket 15-min crypto markets using binance order flow. PPO, temporal encoders, sparse rewards. learning the fundamentals hands-on.

same with crypto — mining ETH at $35 in 2016, did dev for a token that hit $50M+ marketcap, been around through every cycle since.

recent projects: prediction market monitors, claude code leaderboards, multi-agent swarms on solana, real-time interactive video, LoRA marketplaces, youtube thumbnail copilot that got paying customers. earlier: hackathon wins, 10M-view automated youtube channel, lots of other side quests.

infra and fullstack by trade, applied AI and crypto is where i live now.
