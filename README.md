## Professional Overview

Building [HumanPlane](https://humanplane.com)—a prediction market trading terminal, with a longer-term goal of building reality infrastructure. Thoughts and projects at [Sculpt](https://sculpt.fun).

Sold two startups: [RealmPlay](https://realmplay.ai) (Character AI-style product running fine-tuned Llama on consumer GPUs) and [SoulBazaar](https://soulbazaar.ai) (autonomous social agents for web3).

Spent 3+ years at Instacart, ending as Senior SWE and tech lead for Enterprise Ads. Scaled their ad measurement and experimentation platforms, led 10+ engineers across teams, picked up a few awards along the way. Before that, interned at Coinbase (data platform), SeatGeek (data infra), PagerDuty (ML platform + core infra), and Deliverr (fulfillment network). CS at Waterloo.

### About Me

I work at the intersection of applied AI and crypto. The goal is to compound—learn by building, build to learn more, repeat at higher stakes.

Been in AI for a while. For RealmPlay, I productionized a fine-tuned Llama on rented 3090s via vast.ai, built a serving API on exllama, and used a DO droplet with nginx as a load balancer. This was before vLLM existed. Extended context from 4K to 16K using SuperHOT right when RoPE scaling was discovered.

Same with crypto—mining ETH at $35 in 2016, did dev for a token that hit $50M+ marketcap, been around through every cycle since.

Recent projects: prediction market monitors, Claude code leaderboards, multi-agent swarms on Solana, real-time interactive video, LoRA marketplaces, a YouTube thumbnail copilot that got paying customers. Earlier: hackathon wins, a 10M-view automated YouTube channel, and a lot of other side quests.

Infra and fullstack by trade, but applied AI and crypto is where I live now.
