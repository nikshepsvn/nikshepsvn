### About Me
My goal is to build technology that accelerates human progress, allowing for a world where people can earn with creativity instead of labour. Currently, I'm heads down building an innovative, creator-focused platform that is the first step in my journey.

I have been closely following the AI/LLM/Diffusion space since it's inception. [RealmPlay](https://www.realmplay.ai/signin?redirect_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.realmplay.ai%2F), my project-turned-company that was acquired, was built on a fine-tuned, block-merged version of Llama, productionized by building an API on top of [exllama](https://github.com/turboderp/exllama), a framework meant for fast inference using consumer GPUs. I used [vast.ai](https://vast.ai/), renting multiple 3090's to serve production traffic, using a Digital Ocean Droplet and nginx as a multi-region load balancer -- this was well before projects like [vLLM](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm) and other serving frameworks existed. I scaled the context from 4K to 16K with [SuperHOT](https://kaiokendev.github.io/til) the day kaiokendev had the breakthrough of discovering RoPE scaling, which is now commonly used to extend context. 

Most recently (Jan 2025), I sold SoulBazaar -- a launchpad for AI social agents on web3. I built the entire platform from scratch in roughly 1W. After development, I realized my vision for the platform would take a whole lot of time (autonomous social agents that evolve from social interaction, using the internet and engagement as a giant RL playground to build personality, lore, backstory etc.) and sold the platform to a third-party. They web3 enabled the platform and pivoted it into social media marketing agent, the token on launch ($SOULS) reached a $5M+ marketcap.


Some other recent projects I've explored in the space, which gave me significant learnings, include:
- **SoulBazaar (v1)** - the initial version of SoulBazaar was an LLM fine-tune community and marketplace prototype powered by [LoRAX](https://github.com/predibase/lorax)
    - LoRAs, syntethic data generation, fine-tuning, SGMV kernel, tool-calling etc.
- **ThumbGen** - a YouTube Thumbnail Design Copilot (launched, got 10+ paying customers before ramping it down to focus)
    - Diffusion, DiT architecture, generative UI, ComfyUI, IP-Adapter, structured output, prompting techniques etc.
- **Misc hacking** (blog writer agent, video understanding via frame-extraction etc.)
    - Agentic behavior, embedding, RAG, multimodality, etc.

I have a long history building & learning things outside my professional work, some notable projects include:
- **Crypto Development & Mining (2016)**: mined ETH at $35/token, dev for token w/ $50M+ peak marketcap
    - crypto fundamentals, PoW/PoS, smart contract development, marketing/branding etc.
-  **Multiple Hackathons (2017, 2018)**: won prize for headband solution to prevent car accidents, while building at 10+ events
    - built various products and learnt about different core areas, from PHP, app development to cloud and hardware
- **AnimeLootStore (early 2019)**: dropshipped anime merch, ran ads, did 100+ orders
    - design/positioning/branding, marketing via facebook/google Ads, finances, customer experience etc. 
- **FuzzPandaFilms (late 2019)**: YT channel automated w/ reddit content, reached 10M views, 16K subscribers
    - data parsing + processing, programatic video generation, youtube optimization etc.
- **Automated Instagram Pages (2020)**: bot to scrape for viral content and repost on instagram, reaching 5000+ followers
    -  web scraping, data processing / management, APIs etc.
 - **Much much more** -- bunch of OSS libraries, working on decentralized casinos, and a ton of experimentation

While my professional background is largely with Data / Infrastructure / Fullstack engineering, my personal experiences and interests in the AI realm, via building products and following forums like [/r/LocalLLama](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/), [/r/StableDiffusion](https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/) and [X](https://x.com/home) have led to me building an extremely strong and broad foundation in applied AI engineering -- with a solid understanding of model architectures & fundamentals (ssm + transformers + diffusion etc.), fine-tuning (full/LoRA/qLoRA), syntethic data generation pipelines, vector databases / RAG, prompt engineering, agentic behavior/frameworks, structured output, generative UI, evals and other subject matter.
