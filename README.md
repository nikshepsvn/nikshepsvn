My passion lies in building incredible experiences that unlock human creativity by creating new paradigms of interaction with generative AI. 

I have been closely following the space since it's inception ([RealmPlay](https://www.realmplay.ai/signin?redirect_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.realmplay.ai%2F), my first "company" was built on a fine-tuned version of Llama1, productionized by building an API on top of [exllama](https://github.com/turboderp/exllama), a framework meant for fast inference using consumer GPUs on [vast.ai](https://vast.ai/), this was well before [vLLM](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm) and other serving frameworks existed. I scaled the context from 4K to 16K with [SuperHOT](https://kaiokendev.github.io/til) the day kaiokendev had the breakthrough of discovering RoPE scaling, which is now commonly used to extend context).

Some other projects I've explored in the space include:
1. SoulBazaar - an LLM fine-tune community and marketplace powered by [LoRAX](https://github.com/predibase/lorax)
2. ThumbGen - a YouTube Thumbnail Design Copilot using tool-calling & diffusion models
3. Misc. 

These experiences, along with my consistent interest (following [/r/LocalLLama](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/), [/r/StableDiffusion](https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/) and [X](https://x.com/home) religiously) have led to me building an extremely strong foundation in AI engineering -- with a deep understanding of multimodal models (transformers + diffusion), fine-tuning, vector databases / RAG, prompt engineering, agentic frameworks, structured output, generative UI and other subject matter. 

I love staying up to date with the cutting edge developments in the space and would love to chat about related topics -- feel free to reach out for a chat at either nikshep@atmanventures.co or nikshep@dreamloom.ai
